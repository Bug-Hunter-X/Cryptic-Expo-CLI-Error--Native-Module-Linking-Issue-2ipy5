This error typically occurs when there's a mismatch between the native modules required by your Expo app and the native modules available on the device or simulator you're running it on.  This often happens after upgrading Expo, updating native dependencies, or changing the project structure in a way that affects the linking process between your JavaScript code and the native modules it depends on.  

For example, if you're using a library that requires a specific version of a native module, and that version isn't installed or isn't correctly linked, you might get a cryptic error like this. The error message itself is rarely explicit about what specific native module is causing the issue, hence the difficulty in debugging.
