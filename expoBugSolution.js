The solution usually involves a combination of strategies. No single step guarantees success, as the specific issue varies:

1. **Clean and rebuild:** The simplest approach.  Delete the `node_modules` folder, run `expo prebuild`, and then `expo start`. This will re-install and link all your dependencies.  In some cases, a complete project clean (removing `ios` and `android` folders and restarting) may be necessary.

2. **Check package.json:** Verify all your native dependencies (especially those in `dependencies` and `devDependencies`) are compatible with the current Expo SDK version. Look for version conflicts that could cause linking issues.

3. **Examine Podfile (iOS) and build.gradle (Android):**  If the problem persists after a clean rebuild, manually examine the respective native build files for any irregularities or missing dependencies.

4. **Expo diagnostics:** Run `expo diagnostics` to get detailed information about your environment and any potential issues.

5. **Verify native module installations:** Ensure that all necessary native modules are correctly installed and linked using the relevant tools (CocoaPods for iOS, Gradle for Android).

6. **Rollback:** If the issue emerged after an update, consider reverting to a previous version of the affected packages to isolate the problematic change.

7. **Detailed error messages:** When encountering a cryptic error, try to add more logging statements to your app's code (particularly those related to the native modules) to get more specific error information. This helps pinpoint the origin of the problem.

8. **Search for similar issues:** Search online forums and issue trackers for similar error messages or patterns.  Someone may have already encountered and solved the same problem.
